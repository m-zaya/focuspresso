## The Problem

Ever find yourself in this loop?
- Set a task
- Get distracted
- Forget what you were doing
- Remember an hour later
- Repeat

Traditional todo apps fail those of us who struggle with focus and executive function. Gentle reminders are easily ignored, and there's nothing stopping you from jumping to more interesting tasks while the important ones remain undone.

## Our Solution

Focuspresso is a task management app designed specifically for people who:
- Need structure to stay on track
- Struggle with frequent distractions
- Require more persistent reminders
- Benefit from gamification for motivation

## Core Features

### ‚è±Ô∏è Insistent Reminders

- Persistent notifications until tasks are completed
- Impossible to ignore - like having a productivity coach in your pocket

### üìã Enforced Task Sequencing
- Tasks must be completed in chronological order
- No skipping ahead to the "fun stuff"

### Future ‚è≠Ô∏è
